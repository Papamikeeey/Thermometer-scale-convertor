I'm on the journey to learn and master Rust programming language and on my path I have completed Chapter 3 of the Rust book that deals with Programming concepts such as variables and mutability; Control Flow; Functions and Comments.


I took up one of the challenges to come up with a program that solves simple conversion of a scale measurement dealing with Celsius and Fahrenheit.
